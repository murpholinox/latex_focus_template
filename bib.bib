@article{Sayre1998,
abstract = {This paper discusses the concept that crystallinity is not an essential requirement for applying the techniques of X-ray crystal structure analysis. Assuming this to be true, the removal of crystallinity as a prerequisite for the techniques would allow the imaging of structures well beyond the present range of sizes accessible to X-ray crystallography. An example of an imageable structure could be a single small biological cell, containing perhaps 1013-1014 Da. The proposed concept differs from the usual diffraction method of studying noncrystalline structure, i.e. small-angle scattering, in carrying out the diffraction experiment and subsequent processing as if the structure being studied were in fact the asymmetric unit of a crystal: i.e. orienting the structure in all directions in the X-ray beam needed to explore its Fourier transform (F transform), and phasing and inverting the transform to obtain the electron-density image of the structure. The one actual difference from the crystal case is that the F transform is faint and also continuous, rather than displaying discrete intense Bragg spots. As a result, to get a readable pattern, the structure must be exposed to high levels of radiation. This last fact creates the principal limitation of the technique. With single air-dried biological cells at room temperature as diffracting specimens and soft X-rays in the wavelength range 18-32 {\AA}, patterns to date have not been observed beyond resolutions of 140-300 {\AA} before radiation damage has become evident. At this resolution, the technique nevertheless would lie on the same curve of resolution vs specimen size as do the existing major imaging techniques of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and light microscopy, falling directly between the latter two. Thus, X-ray diffractive imaging is not destroyed by the withdrawal of crystallinity but instead is shifted to a new size range of structures, which have hitherto been somewhat inaccessible to imaging. A method for phasing the diffraction pattern, based on the ability to sample the pattern more finely than in the case of the crystalline specimen, is giving good results in preliminary testing. The principal need at present is for better instrumentation for collecting the diffraction data, including the additional motions needed for collecting data in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Radiation damage is an inherent problem in x-ray crystallography. It usually is presumed to be nonspecific and manifested as a gradual decay in the overall quality of data obtained for a given crystal as data collection proceeds. Based on third-generation synchrotron x-ray data, collected at cryogenic temperatures, we show for the enzymes Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase and hen egg white lysozyme that synchrotron radiation also can cause highly specific damage. Disulfide bridges break, and carboxyl groups of acidic residues lose their definition. Highly exposed carboxyls, and those in the active site of both enzymes, appear particularly susceptible. The catalytic triad residue, His-440, in acetylcholinesterase, also appears to be much more sensitive to radiation damage than other histidine residues. Our findings have direct practical implications for routine x-ray data collection at high-energy synchrotron sources. Furthermore, they provide a direct approach for studying the radiation chemistry of proteins and nucleic acids at a detailed, structural level and also may yield information concerning putative 'weak links' in a given biological macromolecule, which may be of structural and functional significance.},

abstract = {The high intensity of third-generation X-ray sources, along with the development of cryo-cooling of protein crystals at temperatures around 100 K, have made it possible to extend the diffraction limit of crystals and to reduce their size. However, even with cryo-cooled crystals, radiation damage becomes a limiting factor. So far, the radiation damage has manifested itself in the form of a loss of overall diffracted intensity and an increase in the temperature factor. The structure of a protein (myrosinase) after exposure to different doses of X-rays in the region of 20 x 1015 photons mm-2 has been studied. The changes in the structure owing to radiation damage were analysed using Fourier difference maps and occupancy refinement for the first time. Damage was obvious in the form of breakage of disulfide bonds, decarboxylation of aspartate and glutamate residues, a loss of hydroxyl groups from tyrosine and of the methylthio group of methionine. The susceptibility to radiation damage of individual groups of the same kind varies within the protein. The quality of the model resulting from structure determination might be compromised owing to the presence of radiolysis in the crystal after an excessive radiation dose. Radiation-induced structural changes may interfere with the interpretation of ligand-binding studies or MAD data. The experiments reported here suggest that there is an intrinsic limit to the amount of data which can be extracted from a sample of a given size.},

abstract = {Background: Exposure of biomacromolecules to ionising radiation results in damage that is initiated by free radicals and progresses through a variety of mechanisms. A widely used technique to study the three-dimensional structures of biomacromolecules is crystallography, which makes use of ionising X-rays. It is crucial to know to what extent structures determined using this technique might be biased by the inherent radiation damage. Results: The consequences of radiation damage have been investigated for three dissimilar proteins. Similar results were obtained for each protein, atomic B factors increase, unit-cell volumes increase, protein molecules undergo slight rotations and translations, disulphide bonds break and decarboxylation of acidic residues occurs. All of these effects introduce non-isomorphism. The absorbed dose in these experiments can be reached during routine data collection at undulator beamlines of third generation synchrotron sources. Conclusions: X-rays can leave a 'fingerprint' on structures, even at cryogenic temperatures. Serious non-isomorphism can be introduced, thus hampering multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing methods. Specific structural changes can occur before the traditional measures of radiation damage have signalled it. Care must be taken when assigning structural significance to features that might easily be radiation-damage-induced changes. It is proposed that the electron-affinic disulphide bond traps electrons that migrate over the backbone of the protein, and that the sidechains of glutamic acid and aspartic acid donate electrons to nearby electron holes and become decarboxylated successively. The different disulphide bonds in each protein show a clear order of susceptibility, which might well relate to their intrinsic stability.},

abstract = {The primary event which occurs when an X-ray photon of energy less than 30 keV is absorbed in a protein crystal (or other organic material) is the production of a photoelectron with a similar energy to that of the absorbed photon. The electron then scatters inelastically off the surrounding material losing energy in the process. This reduction in energy takes place over track lengths of a few $\mu$m for 20 keV electrons. The vector distances between the initial and final positions of the photoelectrons are less than the track lengths owing to the non-linear tracks followed by the electrons. For crystals with smaller dimensions than the vector distances, a significant proportion of the energy could leave the crystal with the high-energy electrons. This could provide an advantage in terms of reduced radiation damage. In order to estimate the possible benefits, calculations of the electron tracks are given, initially using the continuous slowing-down approximation. A Monte Carlo approach is then used to provide more accurate values of the vector distance travelled by electrons inside a protein crystal. The calculations indicate that significant reductions in radiation damage could occur for crystals of a few $\mu$m in size. The benefits would be greater when operating at higher energies. In addition, a scheme for realising the possible benefits in a practical situation is described. This could then form the basis of trial experiments. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

This is particularly true during macromolecular structure determination by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD), where the exploitable signal can be less than a few percent. At the most intense undulator synchrotron beamlines, the effect of radiation damage can be such that all usable signal is obscured. Here the magnitude of this effect in experiments performed at the Se K-edge is quantified. Six successive data sets were collected on the same crystal, interspersed with two exposures to the X-ray beam during which data were not collected. It is shown that the very first data set has excellent phasing statistics, whereas these statistics degrade for the later data sets. Merging several data sets into one, highly redundant, data set only gave moderate improvements as a result of the presence of radiation damage. Part of the damage could be corrected for using a linear interpolation scheme. Interpolation of the data to a low-dose as well as to a high-dose data set allowed us to combine the SAD method with the radiation-damage induced phasing (RIP) technique, which further improved the experimental phases, especially after density modification. Some recommendations are given on how to mitigate the effect of radiation damage during structure determination. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Specific radiation damage can be used to solve macromolecular structures using the radiation-damage-induced phasing (RIP) method. The method has been investigated for six disulfide-containing test structures (elastase, insulin, lysozyme, ribonuclease A, trypsin and thaumatin) using data sets that were collected on a third-generation synchrotron undulator beamline with a highly attenuated beam. Each crystal was exposed to the unattenuated X-ray beam between the collection of a 'before' and an 'after' data set. The X-ray 'burn'-induced intensity differences ranged from 5 to 15{\%}, depending on the protein investigated. X-ray-susceptible substructures were determined using the integrated direct and Patterson methods in SHELXD. The best substructures were found by downscaling the 'after' data set in SHELXC by a scale factor K, with optimal values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. The initial substructures were improved through iteration with SHELXE by the addition of negatively occupied sites as well as a large number of relatively weak sites. The final substructures ranged from 40 to more than 300 sites, with strongest peaks as high as 57$\sigma$. All structures except one could be solved: it was not possible to find the initial substructure for ribonuclease A, however, SHELXE iteration starting with the known five most susceptible sites gave excellent maps. Downscaling proved to be necessary for the solution of elastase, lysozyme and thaumatin and reduced the number of SHELXE iterations in the other cases. The combination of downscaling and substructure iteration provides important benefits for the phasing of macromolecular structures using radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The lifetime of a macromolecular crystal in an X-ray beam is assumed to be limited by the absorbed dose. This dose, expressed in Gray (Gy = J kg -1), is a function of a number of parameters: the absorption coefficients of the constituent atoms of the crystal, the number of molecules per asymmetric unit, the beam energy, flux, size and profile, the crystal size, and the total irradiation time. The effects of these variables on the predicted absorbed dose, calculated using the program RADDOSE, are discussed and are illustrated with reference to the irradiation of a selenomethionine protein crystal of unknown structure. The results of RADDOSE can and will in the future be used to inform the data collection procedure as it sets a theoretical upper limit on the total exposure time at a certain X-ray source. However, as illustrated with an example for which the experimental data are compared with prediction, the actual lifetime of a crystal could become shorter in those cases where specific damage breaks down crucial crystal contacts. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The majority of 3D structures of macromolecules are currently determined by macromolecular crystallography, which employs the diffraction of X-rays on single crystals. However, during diffraction experiments, the X-rays can damage the protein crystals by ionization processes, especially when powerful X-ray sources at synchrotron facilities are used. This process of radiation damage generates photo-electrons that can get trapped in protein moieties. The 3D structure derived from such experiments can differ remarkably from the structure of the native molecule. Recently, the crystal structures of different oxidation states of horseradish peroxidase and nickel-containing superoxide dismutase were determined using crystallographic redox titration performed during the exposure of the crystals to the incident X-ray beam. Previous crystallographic analyses have not shown the distinct structures of the active sites associated with the redox state of the structural features of these enzymes. These new studies show that, for protein moieties that are susceptible to radiation damage and prone to reduction by photo-electrons, care is required in both the design of the diffraction experiment and the analysis and interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Radiation damage to cryocooled protein crystals during x-ray structure determination has become an inherent part of macromolecular diffraction data collection at third-generation synchrotrons. Generally, radiation damage is an undesirable component of the experiment and can result in erroneous structural detail in the final model. The characterization of radiation damage thus has become an important area for structural biologists. The calculated dose limit of 2 × 107 Gy for the diffracting power of cryocooled protein crystals to drop by half has been experimentally evaluated at a third-generation synchrotron source. Successive data sets were collected from four holoferritin and three apoferritin crystals. The absorbed dose for each crystal was calculated by using the program RADDOSE after measurement of the incident photon flux and determination of the elemental crystal composition by microparticle-induced x-ray emission. Degradation in diffraction quality and specific structural changes induced by synchrotron radiation then could be compared directly with absorbed dose for different dose/dose rate regimes: a 10{\%} lifetime decrease for a 10-fold dose rate increase was observed. Remarkable agreement both between different crystals of the same type and between apoferritin and holoferritin was observed for the dose required to reduce the diffracted intensity by half (D1/2). From these measurements, a dose limit of D1/2 = 4.3 (±0.3) × 107 Gy was obtained. However, by considering other data quality indicators, an intensity reduction to IIn2 = In2 × I0, corresponding to an absorbed dose of 3.0 × 107 Gy, is recommended as an appropriate dose limit for typical macromolecular crystallography experiments. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {X-ray damage to protein crystals is often assessed on the basis of the degradation of diffraction intensity, yet this measure is not sensitive to the rapid changes that occur at photosensitive groups such as the active sites of metalloproteins. Here, X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to study the X-ray dose-dependent photoreduction of crystals of the [Fe2S2]-containing metalloprotein putidaredoxin. A dramatic decrease in the rate of photoreduction is observed in crystals cryocooled with liquid helium at 40 K compared with those cooled with liquid nitrogen at 110 K. Whereas structural changes consistent with cluster reduction occur in the active site of the crystal measured at 110 K, no such changes occur in the crystal measured at 40 K, even after an eightfold increase in dose. When the structural results from extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements are compared with those obtained by crystallography on this and similar proteins, it is apparent that X-ray-induced photoreduction has had an impact on the crystallographic data and subsequent structure solutions. These results strongly indicate the importance of using liquid-helium-based cooling for metalloprotein crystallography in order to avoid the subtle yet important changes that can take place at the metalloprotein active sites when liquid-nitrogen-based cooling is used. The study also illustrates the need for direct measurement of the redox states of the metals, through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, simultaneously with the crystallographic measurements. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2007.},

abstract = {Radiation damage to protein crystals is the most serious problem in obtaining accurate structures from protein crystallography. In order to examine the photon energy dependence of radiation damage, 12 to 15 data sets from each of nine tetragonal lysozyme crystals were collected at nine different X-ray energies (6.5, 7.1, 8.3, 9.9, 12.4, 16.5, 20.0, 24.8 and 33.0 keV) using beamline BL41XU at SPring-8. All results were compared on the basis of absorbed dose, expressed in Gray (Gy). Crystallographic statistics, such as the values of lattice constants, Rmerge and I/$\sigma$(I), for each data set degraded at all nine energies as the exposure time for each crystal increased. In all data sets, radiation damage was observed after the absorbed dose exceeded 106 Gy. However, from the point of view of crystallographic statistics normalized to the absorbed dose, no clear dependence on photon energy was observed in these results. Structural refinement showed that the average B-factor for the last data set was larger than that for the first data set at all energies tested. However, no energy dependence of radiation damage on B-factor was found. Furthermore, disruption of disulfide bonds due to radiation damage was observed in electron density maps even at the highest photon energy (33 keV) used in this study. Therefore, these results suggest that radiation damage in the energy range investigated could be evaluated based on absorbed dose without energy dependence, and that it is important to minimize the absorbed dose in a crystal sample for obtaining an accurate protein structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The resolution of X-ray diffraction microscopy is limited by the maximum dose that can be delivered prior to sample damage. In the proposed serial crystallography method, the damage problem is addressed by distributing the total dose over many identical hydrated macromolecules running continuously in a single-file train across a continuous X-ray beam, and resolution is then limited only by the available molecular and X-ray fluxes and molecular alignment. Orientation of the diffracting molecules is achieved by laser alignment. The incident X-ray fluence (energy/area) is evaluated that is required to obtain a given resolution from (i) an analytical model, giving the count rate at the maximum scattering angle for a model protein, (ii) explicit simulation of diffraction patterns for a GroEL-GroES protein complex, and (iii) the spatial frequency cut-off of the transfer function following iterative solution of the phase problem, and reconstruction of an electron density map in the projection approximation. These calculations include counting shot noise and multiple starts of the phasing algorithm. The results indicate counting time and the number of proteins needed within the beam at any instant for a given resolution and X-ray flux. An inverse fourth-power dependence of exposure time on resolution is confirmed, with important implications for all coherent X-ray imaging. It is found that multiple single-file protein beams will be needed for sub-nanometer resolution on current third-generation synchrotrons, but not on fourth-generation designs, where reconstruction of secondary protein structure at a resolution of 7 {\AA} should be possible with relatively short exposures. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2008.},

The crystal structure of xylanase II has been determined with a flux density of about 3 × 1010 photons s-1 $\mu$m-2 at the sample. Two sets of diffraction images collected from different sized crystals were shown to comprise data of good quality, which allowed a 1.5 {\AA} resolution xylanase II structure to be obtained. The main conclusion of this experiment is that a high-resolution diffraction pattern can be obtained from 20 $\mu$m3 crystal volume, corresponding to about 2 × 108 unit cells. Despite the high irradiation dose in this case, it was possible to obtain an excellent high-resolution map and it could be concluded from the individual atomic B-factor patterns that there was no evidence of significant radiation damage. The photoelectron escape from a narrow diffraction channel is a possible reason for reduced radiation damage as indicated by Monte Carlo simulations. These results open many new opportunities in scanning protein microcrystallography and make random data collection from microcrystals a real possibility, therefore enabling structures to be solved from much smaller crystals than previously anticipated as long as the crystallites are well ordered. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

The conclusion of this paper was that higher-energy radiation (e.g. 40 keV) could offer an advantage as the photoelectron path length was greater and less energy would be deposited in the crystal. This paper refines these calculations further by including the effects of energy deposited owing to Compton scattering and the energy difference between the incident photon and the emitted photoelectron. An estimate is given for the optimum wavelength for collecting data from a protein crystal of a given size and composition. Another way of reducing radiation damage from a protein crystal is to collect data with a very short pulsed X-ray source where a single image can be obtained before subsequent radiation damage occurs.

abstract = {Radiation damage is an unwelcome and unavoidable aspect of macromolecular crystallography. In order to quantify the extent of X-ray-induced changes, knowledge of the dose (absorbed energy per unit mass) is necessary since it is the obvious metric against which to plot variables such as diffraction intensity loss and B factors. Significant improvements to the program RADDOSE for accurately calculating the dose absorbed by macromolecular crystals are presented here. Specifically, the probability of energy loss through the escape of fluorescent photons from de-excitation of an atom following photoelectric absorption is now included. For lighter elements, both the probability of fluorescence and of its subsequent escape from the crystal are negligible, but for heavier atoms the chance of fluorescence becomes significant (e.g. 30{\%} as opposed to Auger electron decay from a K-shell excited iron atom), and this has the effect of reducing the absorbed dose. The effects of this phenomenon on dose calculations are presented for examples of crystals of an iron-containing protein, 2-selenomethionine proteins, a uranium derivatised protein, and for a nucleic acid sample. For instance, the inclusion of fluorescent escape results in up to a 27{\%} decrease in the calculated absorbed dose for a typical selenomethionine protein crystal irradiated at the selenium K-edge. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - All rights reserved.},

There have been improvements in the basic procedures such as calibration of the incident X-ray intensity and calculation of the dose likely to be deposited in a crystal of known size and composition with this intensity. There has been increased emphasis on using additional techniques such as optical, Raman or X-ray spectroscopy to complement X-ray diffraction. Apparent discrepancies between the results of different techniques can be explained by the fact that they are sensitive to different length scales or to changes in the electronic state rather than to movement of atoms. Investigations have been carried out at room temperature as well as cryo-temperatures and, in both cases, with the introduction of potential scavenger molecules. These and other studies are leading to an overall description of the changes which can occur when a protein crystal is irradiated with X-rays at both cryo- and room temperatures.

abstract = {A new strategy is presented to reduce primary X-ray damage in macromolecular crystallography. The strategy is based on separating the diffracting and damaged regions as much as feasible. The source of the radiation damage to macromolecular crystals is from two primary mechanisms: the direct excitations of electrons by absorption, and inelastic scattering of the X-rays. The first produces photoelectrons with their accompanying Auger electrons from relaxation of the core hole and the second creates Compton electrons. The properties of these two mechanisms and calculations of primary X-ray damage quantify how to modify the spatial distribution of X-rays to reduce the deleterious effects of radiation damage. By focusing the incident X-rays into vertical stripes, it is estimated that the survival (the time during which quality diffraction data can be obtained with a given X-ray flux) of large crystals can be increased by at least a factor of 1.6, while for very small platelet crystals the survival can be increased by up to a factor of 14. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {In macromolecular crystallography, the acquisition of a complete set of diffraction intensities typically involves a high cumulative dose of X-ray radiation. In the process of data acquisition, the irradiated crystal lattice undergoes a broad range of chemical and physical changes. These result in the gradual decay of diffraction intensities, accompanied by changes in the macroscopic organization of crystal lattice order and by localized changes in electron density that, owing to complex radiation chemistry, are specific for a particular macromolecule. The decay of diffraction intensities is a well defined physical process that is fully correctable during scaling and merging analysis and therefore, while limiting the amount of diffraction, it has no other impact on phasing procedures. Specific chemical changes, which are variable even between different crystal forms of the same macromolecule, are more difficult to predict, describe and correct in data. Appearing during the process of data collection, they result in gradual changes in structure factors and therefore have profound consequences in phasing procedures. Examples of various combinations of radiation-induced changes are presented and various considerations pertinent to the determination of the best strategies for handling diffraction data analysis in representative situations are discussed.},

abstract = {Radiation damage is the major impediment for obtaining structural information from biological samples by using ionizing radiation such as x-rays or electrons. The knowledge of underlying processes especially at cryogenic temperatures is still fragmentary, and a consistent mechanism has not been found yet. By using a combination of single-crystal x-ray diffraction, small-angle scattering, and qualitative and quantitative radiolysis experiments, we show that hydrogen gas, formed inside the sample during irradiation, rather than intramolecular bond cleavage between non-hydrogen atoms, is mainly responsible for the loss of high-resolution information and contrast in diffraction experiments and microscopy. The experiments that are presented in this paper cover a temperature range between 5 and 160 K and reveal that the commonly used temperature in x-ray crystallography of 100 K is not optimal in terms of minimizing radiation damage and thereby increasing the structural information obtainable in a single experiment. At 50 K, specific radiation damage to disulfide bridges is reduced by a factor of 4 compared to 100 K, and samples can tolerate a factor of 2.6 and 3.9 higher dose, as judged by the increase of Rfree values of elastase and cubic insulin crystals, respectively.},

abstract = {The most aggressive product of water radiolysis, the hydroxyl (OH) radical, is responsible for the indirect effect of ionizing radiations on DNA in solution and aerobic conditions. According to radiolytic footprinting experiments, the resulting strand breaks and base modifications are inhomogeneously distributed along the DNA molecule irradiated free or bound to ligands (polyamines, thiols, proteins). A Monte-Carlo based model of simulation of the reaction of OH. radicals with the macromolecules, called RADACK, allows calculating the relative probability of damage of each nucleotide of DNA irradiated alone or in complexes with proteins. RADACK calculations require the knowledge of the three dimensional structure of DNA and its complexes (determined by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or molecular modeling). The confrontation of the calculated values with the results of the radiolytic footprinting experiments together with molecular modeling calculations show that: (1) the extent and location of the lesions are strongly dependent on the structure of DNA, which in turns is modulated by the base sequence and by the binding of proteins and (2) the regions in contact with the protein can be protected against the attack by the hydroxyl radicals via masking of the binding site and by scavenging of the radicals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

For sodium nitrate at a concentration of 0.5 M in chicken egg-white lysozyme crystals, the dose tolerance is increased by a factor of two as judged from the global damage parameters, and no specific structural damage to the disulfide bonds is seen until the dose is greatly in excess (more than a factor of five) of the value at which damage appears in electron density maps derived from a scavenger-free crystal. In the electron density maps, ordered nitrate ions adjacent to the disulfide bonds are seen to lose an O atom, and appear to protect the disulfide bonds.

abstract = {Recent studies have defined a data-collection protocol and a metric that provide a robust measure of global radiation damage to protein crystals. Using this protocol and metric, 19 small-molecule compounds (introduced either by cocrystalliz-ation or soaking) were evaluated for their ability to protect lysozyme crystals from radiation damage. The compounds were selected based upon their ability to interact with radiolytic products (e.g. hydrated electrons, hydrogen, hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals) and/or their efficacy in protecting biological molecules from radiation damage in dilute aqueous solutions. At room temperature, 12 compounds had no effect and six had a sensitizing effect on global damage. Only one compound, sodium nitrate, appeared to extend crystal lifetimes, but not in all proteins and only by a factor of two or less. No compound provided protection at T = 100 K. Scavengers are ineffective in protecting protein crystals from global damage because a large fraction of primary X-ray-induced excitations are generated in and/or directly attack the protein and because the ratio of scavenger molecules to protein molecules is too small to provide appreciable competitive protection. The same reactivity that makes some scavengers effective radioprotectors in protein solutions may explain their sensitizing effect in the protein-dense environment of a crystal. A more productive focus for future efforts may be to identify and eliminate sensitizing compounds from crystallization solutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.

abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction snapshotsg are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (4200nm to 21/4m in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Radiation damage is a major cause of failure in macromolecular crystallography experiments. Although it is always best to evenly illuminate the entire volume of a homogeneously diffracting crystal, limitations of the available equipment and imperfections in the sample often require a more sophisticated targeting strategy, involving microbeams smaller than the crystal, and translations of the crystal during data collection. This leads to a highly inhomogeneous distribution of absorbed X-rays (i.e., dose). Under these common experimental conditions, the relationship between dose and time is nonlinear, making it difficult to design an experimental strategy that optimizes the radiation damage lifetime of the crystal, or to assign appropriate dose values to an experiment. We present, and experimentally validate, a predictive metric diffraction-weighted dose for modeling the rate of decay of total diffracted intensity from protein crystals in macromolecular crystallography, and hence we can now assign appropriate "dose" values to modern experimental setups. Further, by taking the ratio of total elastic scattering to diffraction-weighted dose, we show that it is possible to directly compare potential data-collection strategies to optimize the diffraction for a given level of damage under specific experimental conditions. As an example of the applicability of this method, we demonstrate that by offsetting the rotation axis from the beam axis by 1.25 times the full-width half maximum of the beam, it is possible to significantly extend the dose lifetime of the crystal, leading to a higher number of diffracted photons, better statistics, and lower overall radiation damage.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and online UV-visible absorption microspectrophotometry with X-ray crystallography have been used in a complementary manner to follow X-ray-induced disulfide-bond cleavage. Online UV-visible spectroscopy showed that upon X-irradiation, disulfide radicalization appeared to saturate at an absorbed dose of approximately 0.5-0.8 MGy, in contrast to the saturating dose of ∼0.2 MGy observed using EPR at much lower dose rates. The observations suggest that a multi-track model involving product formation owing to the interaction of two separate tracks is a valid model for radiation damage in protein crystals. The saturation levels are remarkably consistent given the widely different experimental parameters and the range of total absorbed doses studied. The results indicate that even at the lowest doses used for structural investigations disulfide bonds are already radicalized. Multi-track considerations offer the first step in a comprehensive model of radiation damage that could potentially lead to a combined computational and experimental approach to identifying when damage is likely to be present, to quantitate it and to provide the ability to recover the native unperturbed structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography.},

Firstly, several different metrics have been used to monitor and quantify the rate of damage, and, as shown here, these can give results which are in conflict regarding scavenger efficacy. In addition, significant variation in results from data collected from crystals treated in nominally the same way has been observed. Secondly, typical crystallization conditions contain substantial concentrations of chemical species which already interact strongly with some of the X-ray-induced radicals that the added scavengers are intended to intercept. These interactions are probed here by the complementary technique of on-line microspectrophotometry carried out on solutions and crystals held both at 100 K and RT, the latter enabled by the use of a beamline-mounted humidifying device. With the help of computational chemistry, attempts are made to assign some of the characteristic spectral features observed experimentally. A further source of uncertainty undoubtedly lies in the challenge of reliably measuring the parameters necessary for the accurate calculation of the absorbed dose (e.g. crystal size and shape, beam profile) and its distribution within the volume of the crystal (an issue addressed in detail in another article in this issue). While microspectrophotometry reveals that the production of various species can be quenched by the addition of scavengers, it is less clear that this observation can be translated into a significant gain in crystal dose tolerance for macromolecular crystallographers. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore-all rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new approach for collecting data from many hundreds of thousands of microcrystals using X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser has recently been developed. Referred to as serial crystallography, diffraction patterns are recorded at a constant rate as a suspension of protein crystals flows across the path of an X-ray beam. Events that by chance contain single-crystal diffraction patterns are retained, then indexed and merged to form a three-dimensional set of reflection intensities for structure determination. This approach relies upon several innovations: an intense X-ray beam; a fast detector system; a means to rapidly flow a suspension of crystals across the X-ray beam; and the computational infrastructure to process the large volume of data. Originally conceived for radiation-damage-free measurements with ultrafast X-ray pulses, the same methods can be employed with synchrotron radiation. As in powder diffraction, the averaging of thousands of observations per Bragg peak may improve the ratio of signal to noise of low-dose exposures. Here, it is shown that this paradigm can be implemented for room-temperature data collection using synchrotron radiation and exposure times of less than 3ms. Using lysozyme microcrystals as a model system, over 40 000 single-crystal diffraction patterns were obtained and merged to produce a structural model that could be refined to 2.1{\AA} resolution. The resulting electron density is in excellent agreement with that obtained using standard X-ray data collection techniques. With further improvements the method is well suited for even shorter exposures at future and upgraded synchrotron radiation facilities that may deliver beams with 1000 times higher brightness than they currently produce.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have opened up the possibility of structure determination of protein crystals at room temperature, free of radiation damage. The femtosecond-duration pulses of these sources enable diffraction signals to be collected from samples at doses of 1000 MGy or higher. The sample is vaporized by the intense pulse, but not before the scattering that gives rise to the diffraction pattern takes place. Consequently, only a single flash diffraction pattern can be recorded from a crystal, giving rise to the method of serial crystallography where tens of thousands of patterns are collected from individual crystals that flow across the beam and the patterns are indexed and aggregated into a set of structure factors. The high-dose tolerance and the many-crystal averaging approach allow data to be collected from much smaller crystals than have been examined at synchrotron radiation facilities, even from radiation-sensitive samples. Here, we review the interaction of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with materials and discuss the implications for structure determination. We identify various dose regimes and conclude that the strongest achievable signals for a given sample are attained at the highest possible dose rates, from highest possible pulse intensities. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This electronic radiation damage causes the atomic scattering factors to change, affecting, in particular, the heavy atoms, due to their higher photoabsorption cross sections. Here, it is shown that experimental serial femtosecond crystallography data collected with an extremely bright XFEL source exhibit a reduction of the effective scattering power of the sulfur atoms in a native protein. Quantitative methods are developed to retrieve information on the effective ionization of the damaged atomic species from experimental data, and the implications of utilizing new phasing methods which can take advantage of this localized radiation damage are discussed.},

In contrast, despite the large field that is productively engaged in the study of radiation chemistry of nucleic acids, particularly of DNA, there are currently very few X-ray crystallographic studies on radiation damage mechanisms in nucleic acids. Quantitative comparison of damage to protein and DNA crystals separately is challenging, but many of the issues are circumvented by studying pre-formed biological nucleoprotein complexes where direct comparison of each component can be made under the same controlled conditions. Here a model protein-DNA complex C.Esp1396I is employed to investigate specific damage mechanisms for protein and DNA in a biologically relevant complex over a large dose range (2.07-44.63MGy). In order to allow a quantitative analysis of radiation damage sites from a complex series of macromolecular diffraction data, a computational method has been developed that is generally applicable to the field. Typical specific damage was observed for both the protein on particular amino acids and for the DNA on, for example, the cleavage of base-sugar N1 - C and sugar-phosphate C - O bonds. Strikingly the DNA component was determined to be far more resistant to specific damage than the protein for the investigated dose range. At low doses the protein was observed to be susceptible to radiation damage while the DNA was far more resistant, damage only being observed at significantly higher doses.},

Alongside the well known effects of global radiation damage, site-specific radiation damage affects data quality and the veracity of biological conclusions on protein mechanism and function. Site-specific radiation damage follows a relatively predetermined pattern, in that different structural motifs are affected at different dose regimes: in metal-free proteins, disulfide bonds tend to break first followed by the decarboxylation of aspartic and glutamic acids. Even within these damage motifs the decay does not progress uniformly at equal rates. Within the same protein, radiation-induced electron density decay of a particular chemical group is faster than for the same group elsewhere in the protein: an effect known as preferential specific damage. Here, B Damage, a new atomic metric, is defined and validated to recognize protein regions susceptible to specific damage and to quantify the damage at these sites. By applying B Damage to a large set of known protein structures in a statistical survey, correlations between the rates of damage and various physicochemical parameters were identified. Results indicate that specific radiation damage is independent of secondary protein structure. Different disulfide bond groups (spiral, hook, and staple) show dissimilar radiation damage susceptibility. There is a consistent positive correlation between specific damage and solvent accessibility.},

However, the technique is limited by the requirement for macroscopic crystals, which can be difficult to obtain, as well as by the often severe radiation damage caused in diffraction experiments, in particular when using tiny crystals. To slow radiation damage, data collection is typically performed at cryogenic temperatures. With the advent of free-electron lasers (FELs) capable of delivering extremely intense femtosecond X-ray pulses, this situation appears to be remedied, allowing the structure determination of undamaged macromolecules using either macroscopic or microscopic crystals. The latter are exposed to the FEL beam in random orientations and their diffraction data are collected at cryogenic or room temperature in a serial fashion, since each crystal is destroyed upon a single exposure. The new approaches required for crystal growth and delivery, and for diffraction data analysis, including de novo phasing, are reviewed.

abstract = {Conspectus Metal ions and metallocofactors play important roles in a broad range of biochemical reactions. Accordingly, it has been estimated that as much as 25-50{\%} of the proteome uses transition metal ions to carry out a variety of essential functions. The metal ions incorporated within metalloproteins fulfill functional roles based on chemical properties, the diversity of which arises as transition metals can adopt different redox states and geometries, dictated by the identity of the metal and the protein environment. The coupling of a metal ion with an organic framework in metallocofactors, such as heme and cobalamin, further expands the chemical functionality of metals in biology. The three-dimensional visualization of metal ions and complex metallocofactors within a protein scaffold is often a starting point for enzymology, highlighting the importance of structural characterization of metalloproteins. Metalloprotein crystallography, however, presents a number of implicit challenges including correctly incorporating the relevant metal or metallocofactor, maintaining the proper environment for the protein to be purified and crystallized (including providing anaerobic, cold, or aphotic environments), and being mindful of the possibility of X-ray induced damage to the proteins or incorporated metal ions. Nevertheless, the incorporated metals or metallocofactors also present unique advantages in metalloprotein crystallography. The significant resonance that metals undergo with X-ray photons at wavelengths used for protein crystallography and the rich electronic properties of metals, which provide intense and spectroscopically unique signatures, allow a metalloprotein crystallographer to use anomalous dispersion to determine phases for structure solution and to use simultaneous or parallel spectroscopic techniques on single crystals. These properties, coupled with the improved brightness of beamlines, the ability to tune the wavelength of the X-ray beam, the availability of advanced detectors, and the incorporation of spectroscopic equipment at a number of synchrotron beamlines, have yielded exciting developments in metalloprotein structure determination. Here we will present results on the advantageous uses of metals in metalloprotein crystallography, including using metallocofactors to obtain phasing information, using K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy to identify metals coordinated in metalloprotein crystals, and using UV-vis spectroscopy on crystals to probe the enzymatic activity of the crystallized protein.},

A recently emerged serial femtosecond (fs) crystallography (SFX) approach using XFEL radiation overcomes some of the biggest hurdles of traditional crystallography related to radiation damage through the diffraction-before-destruction principle. Intense fs XFEL pulses enable high-resolution room-temperature structure determination of difficult-to-crystallize biological macromolecules, while simultaneously opening a new era of time-resolved structural studies. Here, we review the latest developments in instrumentation, sample delivery, data analysis, crystallization methods, and applications of SFX to important biological questions, and conclude with brief insights into the bright future of structural biology using XFELs. XFELs allow radiation damage to be overcome, enabling the determination of high-resolution room-temperature structures of difficult-to-crystallize proteins, for which only small crystals are available, and of extremely radiation-sensitive macromolecules, such as metalloenzymes. De novo phasing at XFELs has been established on several different targets and by different methods, thereby enabling the determination of the structure of novel macromolecules of biological interest. The extremely short fs duration of XFEL pulses provides access to dynamic information about unstable intermediate states and irreversible reactions. The development of new injectors, crystal delivery media, and fixed target devices has dramatically reduced the amount of required crystallized protein. Mixing injectors provide an important avenue to study biological interactions in 4D space. Developments in data-processing software have reduced the required amount of data and improved data quality.},

Although this is generally the case, several experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that structures from XFELs may not always be radiation-damage free. This is especially true when higher intensity pulses are used and protein molecules that contain heavy elements in their structures are studied. Here, the radiation-damage mechanisms that occur in samples exposed to XFEL pulses are summarized, results that show indications of radiation damage are reviewed and methods that can partially overcome it are discussed.},

abstract = {Radiation damage limits the accuracy of macromolecular structures in X-ray crystallography. Cryogenic (cryo-) cooling reduces the global radiation damage rate and, therefore, became the method of choice over the past decades. The recent advent of serial crystallography, which spreads the absorbed energy over many crystals, thereby reducing damage, has rendered room temperature (RT) data collection more practical and also extendable to microcrystals, both enabling and requiring the study of specific and global radiation damage at RT. Here, we performed sequential serial raster-scanning crystallography using a microfocused synchrotron beam that allowed for the collection of two series of 40 and 90 full datasets at 2- and 1.9-{\AA} resolution at a dose rate of 40.3 MGy/s on hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) crystals at RT and cryotemperature, respectively. The diffraction intensity halved its initial value at average doses (D1/2) of 0.57 and 15.3 MGy at RT and 100 K, respectively. Specific radiation damage at RT was observed at disulfide bonds but not at acidic residues, increasing and then apparently reversing, a peculiar behavior that can be modeled by accounting for differential diffraction intensity decay due to the nonuniform illumination by the X-ray beam. Specific damage to disulfide bonds is evident early on at RT and proceeds at a fivefold higher rate than global damage. The decay modeling suggests it is advisable not to exceed a dose of 0.38 MGy per dataset in static and time-resolved synchrotron crystallography experiments at RT. This rough yardstick might change for proteins other than HEWL and at resolutions other than 2 {\AA}.},
